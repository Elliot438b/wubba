### (1) player bet
- Action params construction. 
> eg. ("100.0000 SYS", "0.0000 SYS", "3.0000 SYS", "4.0000 SYS", "3.0000 SYS")

- Param parser, rules order: 
> betDealer, betPlayer, betTie, betDealerPush, betPlayerPush

- Multi_index table construction. (betType, betAmount) => 
```
player_info
{
    betDealer = 100.0000 SYS
    betPlayer = 0.0000 SYS
    betTIe = 3.0000 SYS
    betDealerPush = 4.0000 SYS
    betPlayerPush = 3.0000 SYS
}
```
### (2) card boot
- bootArray, fix size: 416, index range [0, 415]. Once card used, the value changed to -1.
- validCardArr, storage the index of valid cards in bootArray as value. Once card used, delete the element and the size of array minus one.
- Six seeds. Generated by the root seed parameter. Get a 64 chars though SHA256. Every 9 chars make up one seed in order. (10 chars unused at last.)
- Card parser in bootArray.
    - card number: the value of element.
    - Poker suit: 
```math
suitcolor = (index+1)/13 \% 4
```
**result parser**:

        flag | symbol | full name
        ---|---|---
        0 | S | Spades
        1 | H | Hearts
        2 | D | Diamonds
        3 | C | Clubs

### (3) reveal
- card apply, 4 cards, or 5 cards, or 6 cards? 
> Refer to the rules table:

![image](https://github.com/evsward/wubba/blob/master/resouce/cardapplyrules.jpg?raw=true)

- who win? dealer, player, tie, dealerPush or playerPush? or multy win. 
```math
points = sum of all cards \%10
```
- odds token. 

    type | odds
    ---|---
    dealer | 1:0.95
    player | 1:1
    tie | 1:8
    dealerPush, playerPush | 1:11
### (4) notices
- Bet recall function is implemented on the server end, not SC. Server-end keep the bet cache.
- All actions of SC need both operator and server account authority verification. 
- Tie determined by the first two cards. 
- Add conditions, delete **minPerBet**:
```
oneRoundMaxTotalBet_BP; // max of banker and player total bet.
minPerBet_BP; // min of per banker or player bet.
oneRoundMaxTotalBet_Tie; // max of tie total bet.
minPerBet_Tie; // min of per tie bet.
oneRoundMaxTotalBet_Push; // max of push total bet.
minPerBet_Push; // min of per push bet.
```

```math
oneRoundMaxTotalBet = oneRoundMaxTotalBet\_Push*11*2 + max(oneRoundMaxTotalBet\_BP*1, oneRoundMaxTotalBet\_Tie*8)
```
```math
minTableDeposit = oneRoundMaxTotalBet*minTableRounds
```
- Add verification: verify if dealerBalance > oneRoundMaxTotalBet*2 is false, can't start a new round and call inline action::pausetable.
- Add actions: 
    - pausetable (can recover by continuetable)
    - continuetable
    - closetable (can't recover)
